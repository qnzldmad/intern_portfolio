            <h1>WELCOME TO IMPERIUM EDUMAAX SDN BHD</h1>
            <p>
              Imperium Edumaax Centre for Professional Development and Training
              or better known as CPDT was developed to ensure that employees
              within the Malaysian workforce are given the opportunity to keep
              learning new skills and acquire new knowledge to live and work
              more productively and effectively. <br /><br />
              Furthermore, trainings have been said to increase job satisfaction
              and increase morale among employees resulting in an increase in
              employee motivation, efficacies in processes that delivers
              substantial financial gain and increased capacity to adopt new
              technologies and methods. <br /><br />
              We believe that introducing CPDT will be beneficial to employees
              as trainings have been proven to improve employee retention,
              growth, career development, build self-esteem and most importantly
              to sharpen your confidence in both your personal and professional
              life. Training boosts a feeling of value in employees, and it
              shows that you as an organization are committed in providing the
              resources needed to ensure that each one of your employees are
              doing a good job.<br /><br />
